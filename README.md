```
---

## 📋 Features
```
- View all vehicles currently in the dealership’s inventory  
- Filter vehicles by make, model, price range, or type  
- Search for a vehicle by VIN  
- Add new vehicles to the inventory  
- Remove or purchase vehicles  
- Save and load dealership data  
- User-friendly command-line interface  
```

## 🧠 How It Works
```
The app uses a text-based menu to navigate different operations.  
Dealership data is stored locally and can be saved or loaded using the `DealershipFileManager` class.

**Core Classes:**
- `Dealership` – Stores the list of vehicles and provides methods to manage them  
- `Vehicle` – Represents an individual car with properties like VIN, make, model, price, and year  
- `DealershipFileManager` – Handles file input/output  
- `UserInterface` – Provides menu options and user interaction logic
